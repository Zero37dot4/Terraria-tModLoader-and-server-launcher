The purpose of this project is to make a launcher that launches the 4  versions of terraria which is the terraria, tmodloader, and its server versions.
This is coded in c++.
The location that you should put the exe and the bin folder in is in the same folder as tmodloader and terraria
You can reach out to me in discord

Goal: make the updater be implemented to the exe instead of it being a powershell file
